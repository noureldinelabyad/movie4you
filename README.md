 # Angular Universal project with SSR & SSG/Prerendering
# . SSR: Enable SSR if your application requires better SEO or if you want to improve performance, especially for initial page loads. 
# . SSG/Prerendering: Enable SSG or prerendering when application's content is relatively static and can be generated ahead of time. This can help improve performance and reduce server load by serving pre-rendered static HTML files.
